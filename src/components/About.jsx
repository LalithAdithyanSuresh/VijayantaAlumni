Vijayanta School in Avadi(a suburb of Chennai) has a notable history, especially connected to its origins and the community it serves.Vijayanta school was primarily established in the year 1975 for the children of employees of the Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) and those working in defense-related establishments in Avadi.
<br></br>
<br></br>

The Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) which was set up in 1965 is a key defense production unit of India, specializing in the manufacture of military tanks and other armored vehicles. It's
first indigenously produced tank in India is the "Vijayanta" tank  adding a symbolic significance to the school's name.
The establishment of the school aligns with the government's efforts to support the education of families involved in crucial defense manufacturing.

<br></br>

Initially the school was established as a Matriculation school,then in the  year 1979 Vijayanta School has evolved to offer a comprehensive education adhering to CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) standards. The curriculum focuses on holistic development, including academics, sports, and extracurricular activities.
<br></br>
<br></br>

The school used to be managed directly by HVF, as it was set up primarily to serve the needs of the factory's employees. The management included administrative oversight by HVF officials, with the school's operations closely aligned with the needs and policies of the defense sector.
<br></br>
<br></br>

Over the time, the school expanded and catered to a broader community beyond just HVF employees to accommodate the growing student body and diverse educational needs.
While HVF continued to play a significant role in supporting the school, there was a transition towards a more independent management structure
that included representatives from HVF, education experts, and parent representatives.

Vijayanta School continues to uphold its tradition of providing quality education offering education from kindergarten to higher secondary levels (classes 11 and 12).
